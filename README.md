# Fern-Builders-Analysis

We are going to explore, format, and using the power of MS Excel extrapolate key indicators to answer the questions presented by Fern Builders. 

Fern Builders is a hypothetical consulting company that provides development and consulting work for a majority of companies in the technology and marketing sector. They have publicly presented their last quarters sales data and are expecting their key questions to be answered.

Based on their sales dataset, Fern Builders want to know:
1. How are sales distributed by industry and sector in particular. 
2. Average days it took for the managers to complete their assinged projects. 
3. Cost analysis based of project deliverables (hourly wage to bill ratio)
4. Lastly, a clean dataset void of any duplicates

The original dataset and the finished .xlsx files can be found under the files folder.
